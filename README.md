# Random Choice Picker

![cover](./assets/random.gif)

## ðŸ¦‰ Main information

Little project for picking random choices built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Js.

The project goal:
- as soon as the user starts to type for example 'choice1', it'll format as like a tag below the textarea
- to create another one, a user needs to put a comma and starts to type again (for example 'choice2' etc.)
- when a user hits Enter, it's going to give cool little animation effect and it's going to stop on a random choice
- it's also going to clean the textarea
- set up it in HTML, style it with CSS and add the functionality with JavaScript
